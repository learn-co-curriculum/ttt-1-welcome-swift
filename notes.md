## Objectives

1. Read the output from running tests
2. Use `print` to print "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"
3. Have tests pass locally.
4. Submit solution.

## Notes

  * Give a blank project with tests
  * Goal here is to teach them how to read the error messages that come from the compiler
  * Just give them the instructions of, run the tests, read the output, fix errors, repeat. Similar to this
  * Walk them through all of the errors one can come across when "solving" this lab.
    * Wrong prints
    * Not exactly printing the right thing
